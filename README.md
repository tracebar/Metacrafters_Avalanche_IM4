# DegenToken

A decentralized application (DApp) for managing and utilizing the Degen token, a custom ERC-20 token built on the Ethereum blockchain.

## Description

DegenToken is an ERC-20 token smart contract deployed on the Ethereum blockchain using the Hardhat framework. The token comes with additional functionalities such as minting, burning, and a redemption feature for specific items.

The contract includes the following features:

- **Minting**: The owner of the contract can mint new Degen tokens and distribute them to specific addresses.
